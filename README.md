# Experimental Study on Latent Fingerprint Matching Using Clustered Minutiae Patterns
By Uttam U. Deshpande et al.,


A robust hash-based indexing techniques are proposed to perform matching on large latent fingerprint databases. In these methods, minutia local neighborhood information is extracted to create minutiae features. These obtained minutiae features are invariant to scale, translation, rotation and each minutia is represented as feature vector. This information is further used to construct hash-table and matching is performed

## Introduction 
Latent minutiae fingerprints suffer from low resolution, background noise and non linear distortions. To address these problems, a minutiae feature based hash index
method is required. First we begin with minutiae feature extraction. After obtaining minutiae features, a fixed length minutiae descriptor is created to perform matching.
This descriptor is based on the neighborhood geometry pattern and is invariant to affine minutiae deformations. Hence, it can be directly applied on minutiae based templates. Another advantage of using this descriptor is that there is no need to detect singular points to align the templates.
